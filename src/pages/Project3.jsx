          During the COVID-19 pandemic, safe in-person meetings became a major challenge. As part of a university design project, I worked with a team to develop a modular, ventilated meeting pod that allowed people to collaborate face-to-face while minimizing health risks.

          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            The meeting pod was designed to be easily assembled and disassembled, making it suitable for offices, schools, and public spaces. We focused on airflow, using HEPA filtration and a negative pressure system to reduce the risk of airborne transmission. The pod also featured transparent panels for visibility and communication, while maintaining a physical barrier.

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Our team used rapid prototyping and iterative testing to refine the pod‚Äôs structure and ventilation. We consulted with health experts and incorporated feedback from potential users to ensure the design was both safe and practical. The final prototype balanced safety, comfort, and ease of use, and could be adapted for different environments.

          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <p>
            This project taught me the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and user-centered design, especially when addressing urgent real-world problems. I gained experience in prototyping, teamwork, and communicating with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds.
