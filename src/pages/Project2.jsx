          Diabetes management often requires frequent blood glucose checks, which can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. For my second-year engineering project, I explored a non-invasive approach to glucose monitoring, aiming to make life easier for people with diabetes.

          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            The project focused on developing a wearable device that could estimate blood glucose levels using optical sensors and machine learning algorithms. The prototype used near-infrared light to analyze skin reflectance, correlating the data with glucose concentrations.

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I built several prototypes, experimenting with different sensor placements and wavelengths. Data was collected from volunteers and processed using Python to train a regression model. The device was designed to be comfortable, discreet, and easy to use, with wireless data transmission to a mobile app for real-time monitoring.

          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <p>
            This project taught me about biomedical engineering, signal processing, and the challenges of working with real-world biological data. I gained hands-on experience in hardware prototyping, data analysis, and user-centered design, and developed a deeper appreciation for the impact of engineering on healthcare.
