      description="Designing a project for the BT young scientist competition, which is Irelandâ€™s national Science fair, was a decisive point in my journey so far. I worked as part of a team of three students to develop bins that would sort their own trash. The project was inspired by the idea of making sustainable choices as seamless as possible."
      approach="One of my tasks in this project was building a prototype to showcase this idea. The prototype was a wooden box with some electronic circuits to detect the light refraction angles for sorting materials."
