          My journey into engineering and design began with a passion for sustainability and a desire to solve real-world problems. For the BT Young Scientist competition, I worked with a team to create a self-sorting trash bin that could automatically separate recyclables, making sustainable choices easier for everyone.

          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            The Self-Sorting Trash Bin was designed to identify and sort different types of waste using sensors and a custom-built mechanism. Our goal was to reduce contamination in recycling streams and encourage more people to recycle correctly. The project required us to research sorting technologies, design circuits, and build a working prototype from scratch.

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            We started by brainstorming and sketching ideas, then moved on to prototyping with materials like wood and acrylic. I focused on developing the sensor system, which used light refraction to detect glass bottles. Through multiple iterations, we refined the sorting mechanism and improved its reliability. Presenting our project at the national science fair was a highlight, as we received valuable feedback from judges and visitors.

          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <p>
            This project taught me the value of teamwork, perseverance, and iterative design. I learned how to turn an idea into a functional prototype, troubleshoot technical challenges, and communicate our vision to a broad audience. The experience inspired me to pursue engineering at Trinity College Dublin and continues to influence my approach to problem-solving today.
